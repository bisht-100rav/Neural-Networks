Love adventure, superheroes and Marvel, but this movie was awful and completely booring. This should have been made into a 15 minute ending of the previous movie. Don't understand who this appeals to. We were a mixed gender group and all of us just waited for it to finally end. Don't except anything exciting or interesting. The plot is easy to see through and they fail miserably to create any emotional connection with the audience.
